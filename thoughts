For habitat suitability, consider: a) SURVIVAL and b) ESTABLISHMENT requirements

For a), take min/max temperature (any life stage)*** need to make sure there isn't a case where e.g. repro. min is lower than overall min.
Calculate habt. suitability based on temp x salinity for 1. winter and 2. summer
For each season and for each pixel, calculate mean value and ((AVERAGE MAX))** HOW IS APPLY FUNCTION DOING THIS?
"Intersect" mean with avg. max maps, if EITHER gives a 1 (suitable), give final map a 1 --> take most "conservative" approach (in this case, assume the worst)

Can either produce one map for 1. winter and one for 2. summer, OR combine both of them... Though in this case not sure what intersection rules would be...

PROBLEMS TO RESOLVE:
- When using apply to obtain max values, get warnings():
ddPW_max <- data.frame(apply(ddPrimeWeeks, 1, max, na.rm=TRUE))
